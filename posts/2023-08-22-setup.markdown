title: Rethinking the `setup` convention in Neovim. Is it time for a paradigm shift?
tags: neovim, plugin, lua, dependencies

In the ever-evolving Neovim plugin ecosystem, the usage and appropriateness of a `setup` function
for initializing plugins has become somewhat a hot topic.
This discussion has sparked differing opinions among plugin developers.

Like some other plugin authors, I've recently found myself reverting back to the more traditional
Vim convention of employing `vim.g.<namespaced_table>` or `vim.g.<namespaced_option>`
for configuration, and leaning on the inherent mechanisms of Neovim for initialization.

In this post, I aim to unpack my perspective on this debate,
considering both the present landscape and the potential trajectory of the Neovim plugin ecosystem.


## Drawing parallels: The design journey of my first Neovim plugin

While [`haskell-tools.nvim`](https://github.com/mrcjkb/haskell-tools.nvim/) wasn't technically my first
Neovim plugin, it holds the distinction of being the first that wasn't merely an adapter or extension
for another.
If the name resonates with you, it's likely because I drew inspiration from the popular
[`rust-tools.nvim`](https://github.com/simrat39/rust-tools.nvim).
Both plugins, though tailored for different programming languages, share a parallel purpose.

`rust-tools`, for historical reasons, depends on `nvim-lspconfig`.
It relies on a `setup` function to kickstart the `lspconfig.rust_analyzer.setup`, among other things.
As I was relatively new to Lua and Neovim plugin development, this structure felt like a logical
blueprint for `haskell-tools`.
Which led to [this module](https://github.com/mrcjkb/haskell-tools.nvim/blob/3ac5c19a0742cc80c65bab9525ac3e7a9c54ab93/lua/haskell-tools/init.lua):

```lua
local M = {
  config = nil,
  lsp = nil,
  hoogle = nil,
  repl = nil,
}

function M.setup(opts)
  -- initialization omitted for brevity
end

return M
```

As a Haskell developer, seeing state - initialized with `nil` - was profoundly unsettling.
Despite my reservations, the `setup` paradigm was omnipresent in most Lua plugins I was using.
So I decided to go along with it. This, as [**@HiPhish** puts it very well](https://gitlab.com/HiPhish/rainbow-delimiters.nvim/-/blob/7506a7d6/doc/rainbow-delimiters.txt?ref_type=heads#L150),
was [cargo cult programming](http://www.jargon.net/jargonfile/c/cargocultprogramming.html).

## Tracing the origins of `setup`

Neovim embraced Lua as a first-class citizen [with version `0.5`](https://neovim.io/news/2021/07).
Though the initial API wasn't as powerful as the one we enjoy today,
it marked the onset of an explosive growth in Lua plugins.
However, the roots of the `setup` pattern trace back even earlier. Neovim contributor [**@norcalli**
introduced a library designed "to standardize the creation of Lua based plugins in Neovim."](https://github.com/norcalli/neovim-plugin),
almost a year before Lua's elevated status[^1].

[^1]: The credit for tracing the origins of `setup` goes to [**@RRethy**](https://github.com/RRethy/vim-illuminate/issues/112#issuecomment-1221213332).

From this effort, `setup` was born:

> - Plugins shouldn't use the api unless the user explicitly asks them to by calling a function.
>   - For one time initialization for a plugin, this is achieved by having a `setup()` function
>     which will do any initialization required unrelated to key mappings, commands, and events.
>   - Every other call should be encapsulated by functions exported by the plugin.

Observant readers may notice a subtle difference between the foundational approach and the
conventions that are prevalent today.
In **@norcalli**'s blueprint, [configuration and initialization were decoupled](https://github.com/norcalli/neovim-plugin/blob/master/examples/test.lua),
with an `export` function designated for configuration and `setup` exclusively managing initialization.
In contrast, many of today's plugins meld these two by passing a configuration table directly to `setup`.
We will revisit this later on...

## Neovim 0.7 - Lua everywhere!

Remember, this `setup` concept originated before Lua's deep integration in Neovim.
Well before `init.lua` and auto-loading Lua files on the [`runtimepath`](https://neovim.io/doc/user/options.html#'runtimepath')
arrived with [version 0.7](https://neovim.io/news/2022/04).
This version brought with it many improvements to the Lua API.
And it was a few months after the release of Neovim 0.7 that [**@mfussenegger** posted
an article](https://zignar.net/2022/11/06/structuring-neovim-lua-plugins/#require-performance)
which made me realise I had stuctured my `haskell-tools` plugin wrong.

His article (which I strongly recommend reading) differentiates between global and filetype-specific plugins.
For Lua plugins, he presents some advantages and disadvantages of various structuring approaches
and two configuration methods:

- A `setup` function, which is "useful if the plugin performs expensive initialization or if
  what it initializes depends on the configuration", but forces users to `require` the plugin,
  which may impact startup if not managed properly.
- A single global configuration table, like `vim.g.foobar_settings`, which omits the
  need for a `require`, and provides direct access across multiple modules, but may be harder to
  validate.

## `haskell-tools` redesigned

Continuing the trajectory of Neovim 0.7’s advancements, [`filetype.lua`](https://neovim.io/news/2022/04#filetypelua),
emerged as a notable (experimental) addition. By the time Neovim 0.9 rolled around,
it had effectively replaced the older `filetype.vim`.
Initially, `haskell-tools.setup` employed autocommands for Haskell and Cabal files.
This approach could bog down startup times, especially if multiple plugins adopted it.
Addressing this, I rolled out the `start_or_attach` function for more efficient initialization,
tailored for lazy invocation within users' `after/ftplugin/<haskell|cabal>.lua` scripts.
This shift also severed the plugin's tie to `nvim-lspconfig` for LSP tasks.
But, in a nod to [backward compatibility](https://www.snoyman.com/blog/2018/04/stop-breaking-compatibility/),
the original `setup` function remained, bringing along its inherent codebase intricacies.

After recent consideration, I have finally decided to release version 2 of `haskell-tools.nvim`.

## The pitfalls of `setup`

@mfussenegger clarifies in his article that he does not advocate against a `setup` function.
While I think his article is a great read, I have personally come to the conclusion that
`setup` as we know it must burn. Here's why...

![](https://github.com/mrcjkb/mrcjkb.github.io/assets/12857160/fd85e99a-4dac-4f3d-88f7-83f6246a1a62){ width=550px }

### A false sense of "consistency"

The most common argument I hear in favour of defaulting to `setup` is "consistency". In fact,
today's most popular Lua plugin manager, [`lazy.nvim`, defaults to
calling `require(MAIN).setup(opts)`](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim#-plugin-spec)
in the absence of a `config` option.
But as we've delved into before, the term "setup" is used ambiguously across plugins.
For instance, while plugins like `nvim-treesitter` and `telescope.nvim` lean on Neovim's inherent
initialization and employ `setup` solely for configuration,
others like `nvim-cmp` and `nvim-lspconfig` use the same term for both roles.
This facade of uniform naming masks its varied functionalities, leading to false consistency.

Furthermore, global configuration variables or tables, prefixed with a namespace specific to the plugin,
are both consistent and compatible with the Vimscript plugin ecosystem.

![](https://github.com/mrcjkb/mrcjkb.github.io/assets/12857160/2de0fa4f-adec-45c9-862d-78756c444bae){ width=550px }

### The mirage of `setup`-driven expectations

The `setup` convention in Neovim plugins has inadvertently set certain expectations among users.
A notable interaction I had with a user when I decided to remove it from `haskell-tools.nvim` showcased this:
the absence of a familiar `setup` function made the configuration feel "strange" and "out of place" to them.
Further, they worried it would prevent them from conditionally loading or initializing the plugin.

This sentiment points to a broader issue.
The prevalent use of the `setup` function has conditioned users to expect it as a standard
for configuring and initializing plugins.
This expectation can overshadow alternative, and sometimes more flexible, configuration methods.

Neovim itself offers [built-in mechanisms for conditional plugin loading](https://neovim.io/doc/user/repeat.html#packages),
and many plugin managers support similar functionalities.
However, the ubiquity of the `setup` convention might be inadvertently limiting our view and adaptability,
leading us to perceive deviations as anomalies, even when they may offer superior flexibility.


### `require`-ing plugins at startup can break your config

To create robust plugins, it's imperative to differentiate between configuration and initialization.
This becomes particularly crucial when plugins have interdependencies.
Careless `require` calls during the configuration phase can induce unexpected hiccups,
primarily influenced by the order of initialization.
The best practice? Make such calls deferred or lazy.

Let's illustrate with an example:

#### Not ideal

```lua
-- May fail if foo is not initialized
-- before lspconfig
local bar = require('foo').bar
require('lspconfig').clangd.setup {
  on_attach = function(_)
    bar.do_something()
  end,
}
```

#### Better

```lua
require('lspconfig').clangd.setup {
  on_attach = function(_)
    -- Will fail only if foo is never initialized
    require('foo').bar..do_something()
  end,
}
```

Now, imagine a scenario where `nvim-lspconfig` isn't even present or loaded.
Neovim's startup would choke on `require('lspconfig')`,
halting further configurations even if the plugin isn't immediately required.

However, if `nvim-lspconfig` leveraged `filetype.lua` and `vim.g`, things would look different:

- Configuration snippet:

```lua
vim.g.lspconfig = {
  clangd = {
    filetypes = {'c', 'cpp'},
    -- additional settings...
  }
}
```

- The initialization script (orchestrated by the plugin, not the user):

```lua
-- ftplugin/c.lua
local clangd = vim.g.lspconfig and vim.g.lspconfig.clangd
if clangd.filetypes and vim.tbl_contains(clangd.filetypes, 'c') then
  -- config validations and clangd initialization performed and cached in 'lspconfig.cache.clangd'
  require('lspconfig.cache.clangd')
  require('lspconfig.configs').clangd.launch()
end
```

In such a setup, Neovim doesn't break a sweat,
even if `nvim-lspconfig` remains unloaded when `init.lua` processes `vim.g.lspconfig_clangd`.

### Automatic dependency management's Achilles' Heel

Efforts to resolve [pain points](https://mrcjkb.dev/posts/2023-01-10-luarocks-tag-release.html)
in Neovim's plugin ecosystem have gravitated towards automatic dependency management.

Two notable initiatives[^2] are:

- [Hosting plugins on LuaRocks.org](https://luarocks.org/labels/neovim)
  and [installing them with `luarocks`](https://github.com/ntbbloodbath/rocks.nvim).
- [The `pkg.json` (`packspec`) format specification](https://packspec.org/spec.html)
  for plugin metadata and dependencies.

[^2]: Notably, these work in progress approaches [are not mutually exclusive](https://github.com/nvim-neorocks/luarocks-tag-release/discussions/73#discussioncomment-6552899).

Given Vim's architecture (and by extension Neovim's), there's a specific [initialization order](https://neovim.io/doc/user/starting.html#initialization)
where user preferences load before plugins. Ring a bell?


A lurking issue arises when plugins blend their configuration and initialization phases in one
`setup` function.
By doing this and handing over the initialization reins to the user,
the core advantages of automatic dependency management risk getting undermined.

![](https://github.com/mrcjkb/mrcjkb.github.io/assets/12857160/898f9b14-9608-4314-a671-62d81008473b){ width=500 }

It should be a plugin's duty to articulate its dependencies rather than leaving it to users or plugin managers.
In the same spirit, plugins should defer their own initialization until all their dependencies are up and running.

Take a look at [this snippet from `neodev.nvim`'s](https://github.com/folke/neodev.nvim/tree/v2.5.2#-setup)[^3] README:

[^3]: For the record, I'm quite a fan of this plugin.

```lua
-- IMPORTANT: make sure to setup neodev BEFORE lspconfig
require("neodev").setup({
  -- add any options here, or leave empty to use the default settings
})

-- then setup your lsp server as usual
local lspconfig = require('lspconfig')

-- example to setup lua_ls and enable call snippets
lspconfig.lua_ls.setup({
  settings = {
    Lua = {
      completion = {
        callSnippet = "Replace"
      }
    }
  }
})
```

Highlighting this, had there been a distinct line between configuration and initialization responsibilities,
warnings like these wouldn't be necessary.

### What about namespace clashes and clutter?

The traditional way in Vimscript was to have a `vim.g.<some_option>` for each configuration option,
typically prefixed with the plugin name, to avoid namespace clashes.
This can introduce a lot of clutter. Fortunately, in Lua, `vim.g.foo_bar` can also be a single table,
which is no more likely to clash than a module name.

```lua
-- Instead of:
vim.g.plugin_name_option1 = "value1"
vim.g.plugin_name_option2 = "value2"
vim.g.plugin_name_option3 = "value3"

-- We can have:
vim.g.plugin_name = {
  option1 = "value1",
  option2 = "value2",
  option3 = "value3"
}
```

This approach keeps the global namespace clean and reduces the chances of clashes.

### What about a `configure` function?

While there's no inherent issue with a `configure` function (or even a `setup` function solely
dedicated to configuration), its use can indeed simplify the validation of user configurations.

So, why do I caution against its adoption?

Remember the evolution of @norcalli's `export`/`setup` pattern into a unified function?
The crux of the matter lies in the fact that Lua functions can be inherently impure.
This means there's nothing stopping plugin developers from crafting their `configure` functions
in less than ideal ways, such as:

```lua
M.configure(opts) = function
  -- <do something with opts>
  vim.api.nvim_launch_nuclear_warhead()
end
```

On the other hand, employing a `vim.g` variable offers an implicit assurance of its singular role
in configuration.
While this might introduce complexity in validating configurations, Neovim offers a robust solution:
the [`:checkhealth`](https://neovim.io/doc/user/pi_health.html#health-dev) mechanism.
For an illustration of its effective utilization, [see this example](https://github.com/mrcjkb/haskell-tools.nvim/blob/2e06bf7fb458356913f1fc7961f1d3c21c7163a1/lua/haskell-tools/health.lua#L225)
from my `haskell-tools.nvim` plugin.

### But... Global variables are an antipattern?

Global mutable state is an antipattern. We're talking about read-only global configuration variables.

## Enter a world without `setup`

In light of these considerations, it is increasingly clear that the Neovim community may benefit
from moving beyond the `setup` function, or at least the way it’s been traditionally employed.
The `setup` function, as it stands today, isn't the villain.
However, the consequences of its misuse, ambiguity, and lack of clear separation of concerns in
many plugins are real issues that need addressing.

### So, what should the ideal look like?

1. **Decoupled Configuration and Initialization**:
  This has been reiterated multiple times,
  but it's worth emphasizing. Configuration should be separated from initialization.
  This ensures that configuration is pure, readable, and unlikely to produce unexpected side effects.

1. **Utilize `vim.g` for Configuration**:
  As has been demonstrated, `vim.g` provides an ideal means to store plugin configuration.
  It aligns well with Vim conventions, provides an implicit assurance of its configuration-only role,
  and circumvents the need to `require` the plugin at startup.

1. **Smart Initialization**:
  Instead of relying on users or external mechanisms for activation,
  tools should employ intelligent self-initialization.
  For example, leveraging constructs like `filetype.lua` can defer their loading until genuinely required.
  However, for plugins with minimal startup footprints, lazy loading might be excessive.

1. **Explicit Dependency Declaration**:
  Plugins should clearly specify any dependencies,
  and the initialization of such plugins should ensure that these dependencies are loaded before proceeding.

### Some caveats

No approach is without its drawbacks. Some possible criticisms of moving away from `setup` are:

- **Learning Curve**:
  This change would introduce a learning curve,
  especially for newer users who are already accustomed to the `setup` pattern.
  On the other hand, this approach discourages cargo cult programming and promotes genuine understanding.

- **Migration**:
  Existing plugins that heavily rely on the `setup` pattern might need significant rewrites.
  While this is an investment in future robustness, it might be daunting for some plugin authors
  and users alike.

- **Performance**:
  While unlikely, there's always the potential for performance implications when making a sweeping change.
  However, any such implications would likely be minimal and far outweighed by the benefits.

### Guided migration: A step-by-step plan

For plugin maintainers, especially those with a large user base,
the thought of introducing breaking changes can be daunting.
However, with a structured approach, you can ensure a smooth transition for both you and your users.
Here's a suggested plan to phase out the `setup` function:


1. **Embrace a Rigorous Release Cycle**:
   Start by tagging releases with [semantic versions](https://semver.org/) and/or maintaining a stable
   branch if you haven't already. This provides a clear framework for introducing changes.

2. **Prioritize Separation of Concerns**:
   If your plugin conflates configuration and initialization in a single function,
   consider splitting these concerns.
   Initially, transition to a `setup` function dedicated only to configuration while optimizing initialization.
   This change is unlikely to disrupt most users.

3. **Support Both APIs Temporarily**:
   By concurrently supporting both the old and new APIs, you provide users with a transition period.
   Consider implementing prompts (with an option to disable them) to guide users towards the new method.

4. **Introduce the New API in a Separate Branch**:
   Create a branch that omits the `setup` function, and actively promote this to your users.
   Encourage them to switch and provide feedback.

## In Conclusion

In the constantly evolving world of Neovim plugins, it's important to reflect on established patterns
and consider their effectiveness. The `setup` pattern, while helpful in certain contexts,
has shown potential pitfalls.

By championing a clear division between configuration and initialization and embracing tools like `vim.g` for the former,
we pave the way for a more robust, predictable, and user-friendly Neovim plugin ecosystem.

As developers and users of Neovim plugins, it's up to us to guide this evolution in a direction that
benefits the entire community. Let's strive for clarity, simplicity, and robustness as we move forward!
